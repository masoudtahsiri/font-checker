# PeekFont Privacy Policy

Last updated: March 2024

## Introduction

PeekFont ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Chrome extension, PeekFont.

## Information We Don't Collect

PeekFont is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. Specifically, we do not collect:

- Personal information
- Browsing history
- Website content
- Font information
- Usage statistics
- Analytics data
- Location data
- Device information

## How PeekFont Works

PeekFont operates entirely locally on your device:

1. **Local Processing**: All font inspection and analysis is performed directly in your browser
2. **No Data Transmission**: No data is sent to our servers or any third parties
3. **No Storage**: No information is stored beyond your current browser session
4. **No Tracking**: No tracking mechanisms are implemented

## Technical Implementation

PeekFont uses the following Chrome Extension APIs:

- `activeTab`: Used only when the extension is clicked to inspect the current tab
- `scripting`: Used to inject the content script for font inspection
- `storage`: Used locally to remember your extension preferences

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and do not involve any data collection or transmission.

## Third-Party Services

PeekFont does not use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.
